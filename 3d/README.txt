The rotor is based on this design:

I downloaded the .stl-File, imported it into FreeCad and used the
Python console to scale the mesh by (1.04, 1.04, 1.00) to adjust from
US to EUR coin sizes.

In addition, I added a shim for the rotor axis to fit my DC gear
motor.  This part can be exported and printed individually for
testing how snug it fits.

To export the design, you need to select these two parts and export
them together as .obj-file (included here for your convenience).  This
can be directly loaded by cura for printing.

Printed with PLA through a 0.4mm nozzle, using a layer size of 0.1mm.
